# Configuration Management Plan for Group 19

## Source control
4.Other.  
This group will only use branches for rare, large changes, all other changes will be pushed directly into master. This is done because using pull requests means that we must have someone to act as a “leader” and decide which code will be merged to the master, something that we don’t want to do. We will use branches for large changes as most people will not feel confident changing a large part of the code on the master branch. In the rare occasion of a pull request there will be a predefined person to accept the request. 

## Code Reviews

 1.This group will perform code reviews on every push to master and pull request (where applicable).  
This way it is ensured that every time code is uploaded to the repo, it is actually code of good quality which builds correctly with no errors. This way we eliminate the chance of having broken code in the repo and having someone add more features to a code that does not build.

## Coding Standards

 3.This group will apply a custom coding standard.  
 We will use Google's existing coding standard but we decided to remove some of the rules, as the existing rules are too demanding and having no coding standard at all would result in an a coding style that is not consistent and would be too messy .
